**Electronic commerce
commonly known as e-commerce, it is a type of industry, where buying
and selling of product or service is conducted over electronic systems such as the internet and
other computer.
Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds
transfer, supply chain management, internet marketing, online transaction processing,
electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management system and automated data
collection systems.

**History of e-commerce**
The beginnings of e-commerce can be traced to the 1960s, when businesses started using EDI
to share business documents with other companies. In 1979, the American National Standards
Institute developed ASC X12 as a universal standard for businesses to share documents through
electronic networks.
After the number of individual users sharing electronic documents with each other grew in the
1980s, the rise of eBay and Amazon in the 1990s revolutionized the e-commerce industry.
Consumers can now purchase endless amounts of items online, from e-tailers, typical brickand-mortar stores with e-commerce capabilities. Now, almost all retailer companies are
integrating online business practices into their business models.

**How does e-commerce work?**
E-commerce is fueled by the web, where clients can get to a web store to browse through and
put orders for items or administrations through their possess devices. As the order is set, the
customer's web browser will communicate back and forward with the server facilitating the
online store site. Information relating to the arrange will at that point be handed-off to a central
computer known as the order manager -- at that point sent to databases that oversee stock levels,
a dealer framework that oversees installment data (utilizing applications such as PayPal), and
a bank computer -- some time recently circling back to the order manager. This is often to form
beyond any doubt that store stock and client reserves are adequate for the order to be processed.
After the order is approved, the order manager will inform the store's web server, which is able
at that point display a message informing the client that their order has been effectively
prepared.

**Purpose**
The main purpose of this project is to create website that allows people to buy and sell physical
goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location.
Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage
shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.

**Scope**
The scope of the project is managing a consistency and storage of data by dedicated data
administrator. It provides most of the features that a Database Management System should
have. It is developed by using MySQL database. It has been implemented in WINDOWS
platform.
